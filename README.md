Operating System Resource Management and Process Scheduling Simulator

Features:

CPU Scheduling:

Allows simulation of various CPU scheduling algorithms.
Options for tracing execution or viewing statistics.
Algorithms supported include First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), and others.
Banker's Algorithm:

Simulates the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance.
Includes matrix management, safety checks, and resource allocation/release.
Single Instance Deadlock Detection:

Handles deadlock detection using Wait-For Graphs (WFG).
Features graphical representation using Graphviz.
Usage:

Compile and run the program in a C++ environment.
Follow the main menu to navigate through features:
Select CPU Scheduling for scheduling simulations.
Select Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance checks.
Select Single Instance Deadlock Detection for WFG-based deadlock detection.
Requirements:

Graphviz installed for graphical outputs.
C++ compiler supporting standard libraries like iostream, vector, and Windows-specific headers.
Note: This simulator is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate operating system concepts like resource allocation, scheduling, and deadlock detection.
